# Redefining-Cancer-Treatment
Motivation: Kaggle Competition

challenge here is to distinguish the Genetic mutations that contribute to tumour growth(Cancer). Currently this interpretation of genetic mutations is being done manually. This is a very time-consuming task where a clinical pathologist must manually review and classify every single genetic mutation based on evidence from text-based clinical literature.

Tasks:
•	Identifying the Real-World objectives and Constraints
•	Formulating the Classification Problem
•	Data Cleaning and Visualization
•	Univariant analysis on all features 
•	Develop methods/experiment to evaluate the performance of different ML classification models
Language: Python
